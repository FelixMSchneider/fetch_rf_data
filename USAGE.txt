   parameters have to be changed in file fetch_parameter.py

   network=NETCODE
   DATAPATH: PATH where downloaded data are stored

   use_routing_client=True/False

       if use_routing_client=True 
           client = RoutingClient("eida-routing", credentials={'EIDA_TOKEN': EIDATOKENPATH}) is used.
           this option is needed when you want to download restricted data, which is accessable with ein EIDA_TOKEN

           EIDATOKENPATH="/home/felix/eidatoken" has to be provided in this case.

       if use_routing_client=False
           client = Client(dataclient) is used
           In this case dataclient has to be provieded. The list of possible provides are listed in fetch_parameter.py



1) GENERATE GLOBAL EARTHQUAKE CATALOGUE

   A global earthquake catalog has to be downloaded. This can be done with:

    python generate_global_catalogue.py

    (only 1 time needed)

   a global catalogue is already provided with the scripts, ranging from 
   1980 to Nov_2021: GLOBAL_EQ_CAT_1980_112021_MGT55.txt

   If this catalogue is used, step 1) can be skipped.


2) GENERATE STATIONLIST FOR NETWORK

   a stationlist has to be generated with

   python get_stationlist.py


   the resulting stationlist is stored in DATAPATH/NETCODE/stationlist_NETCODE.txt
   and can edited (e.g. delete stations) if you wish



3) GENERATE INDIVIDUAL EVENT CATALOGUES:

    
     EITHER:

      a single earthquake cataologue for the network cat be generated with
    
         python generate_catalogue.py CLAT CLON  (where CLAT CLON are the central lat lon of the network)
    
         python generate_catalogue.py STATIONNAME (where STATIONNAME should be a central station)
    
      in both cases the catalogue is saved in DATAPATH/NETWORK/SRF-EVENTS.txt
    
      you can edit this file (delete lines) if you wish
    
    
     OR:
    
      an earthquake cataologue is generated for each station individually (recommended for large networks)
    
         python generate_catalogue.py stationlist.txt

       Individual catalogues are saved in folder DATAPATH/NETCODE/NETCODE.STATIONNAME/SRF-EVENTS.txt
        
       you can edit these files individually (delete lines) if you wish


4) GET DATA 

  EITHER:

  python get_data_single_station_bulk.py STATIONNAME

  -> data will be downloaded for tha single station and stored in DATAPATH

  OR: 

  bash get_data_many_stations.sh

  -> data will be downloaded for all stations in "DATAPATH/NETCODE/stationlist_NETCODE.txt"

   if a catalogue exists in the directory NETCODE.STATIONNAME/SRF-EVENTS.txt the script will use this one, otherwise
   the catalogue in ./SRF-EVENTS.txt is used.
